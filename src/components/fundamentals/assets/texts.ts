    `For someone unfamiliar to the world of banking and finance, the whole thing can seem 
    very confusing. Not only is banking and economics seemingly very complex (the Financial 
    Times is full of special jargon, charts and graphs), but most people base their understanding
    of this world from polemical news articles, social media, or the general public without 
    ever having wondering how bankers themselves see it.`,
    `To think like a banker is simply to think in terms of balance sheets, and making sure 
    the numbers on both sides amount to the same number. The banker is primarily concerned 
    with making sure that their ingoings match their outgoings. These balance sheets will 
    belong not only to banks, but businesses, governments, customers etc. Everyone is bank 
    and everyone has a balance sheet.`,

    `A balance sheet is a T shaped graph that has two sides. One side consists
    of assets, and the other side consists of liabilities. Assets are things that
    you own, like money or a car, and liabilities are things that you
    owe to someone else, which could also be money or a mortgage etc.
    Please note that in this example the bank's liabilities are 'deposits' and
    the customer's assets are also 'deposits'. Both the bank and the customer have
    cash as an assets, which counts towards their reserves, but the customer's cash 
    is not shown here (maybe its in their back pocket).But what is the difference between cash 
    and deposits? `,
    `It seems like common sense to assume when we deposit cash at the bank, the money 
    is waiting in a vault inside the bank for us somewhere as cash to withdraw. 
    The truth is a little more complicated, but not too much. When a customer puts their 
    money in a bank, they receive a deposit in return. A deposit is actually different 
    to the cash that the customer puts in the bank. A deposit means money that the bank 
    owes to its customer, and which the customer can demand at any point to be redeemed in cash.
    In fact there are much more deposits than there is cash money. According to the 
    Bank of England, only 4% of the money in the UK is cash; 96% is deposits. The same is true
    in many countries in the world. The money is digital.`,
    `In your local bank branch it is certain that there is more money in deposits (which are just 
    numbers in a database) than there is cash in the vaults. Fortunately not everyone is going 
    to go the bank to withdraw their money all at once, otherwise the bank would not be able 
    to follow on their promise to redeem the customer's deposits on demand. During times of 
    financial uncertainty there may be large queues outside banks, 
    with people trying to withdraw their deposits as cash (try googling 'Northern Rock').
    This illustrates the fact that there is in fact some uncertainty as to the status of deposits 
    compared to cash. You could say that one money is better than the other. As will become clearer as you go
    through each module in the course, there are many types of money, and they line up in a hierarchy!
    Hopefuly this serves as a simple illustration of that fact.`,

  paragraphs: [
    `We have seen how a bank takes a customer's money and exchanges them for deposits. On the bank's balance sheet, the deposits are counted as liabilities and the cash is part of the reserves on the assets side of the balance sheet.
    We will now look at bank transfers. We transfer money when we want or have to give someone money in payment.
    Outside of the banking system we could do this by simply handing the other person cash. But inside of
    the banking system this is done by online transfer, or by check. And in this case we are not transfering cash but instead
    we are transfering the deposits from our account into their account.`,
    `So what happens in the balance sheets when customers make transfers? If a bank has two customers, both depositing £100, the bank would have £200 in reserves and £200 of deposits, which the bank owes to its customers. If Customer One transfered some of their deposits to Customer Two, no change would occur in the bank's total assets or liabilities, even though a change between the accounts of customer One and customer Two has occured.
    As we will see later, it is a different situation when customers transfer deposits to customers with a different bank account to their own.`,

    `Now that the bill of exchange has finally been redeemed where do we stand? As far 
    as 'Me' and Salviati are concerned the transaction is over. 'Me' has received payment 
    for goods shipped and Salviati has paid for goods received. But 'You' have negative 
    equity and Tomasso has 1 gold marc that isn't really his. The gold marc that Tomasso has 
    really belongs to 'You' and will have to pay it back somehow. So what is next for the 
    exchange bankers? Some extra background will help to understand what is next.`,
    `At the central fairs already discussed, exchange rates have been decided and published 
    in what is called the 'conto'. The conto announces what 1 gold marc (the bankers unit of 
    exchange) is worth in different currencies. In Florence, a bill for 1 gold marc drawn 
    in Lyons is worth 64 ecus. This amount is known because it is Lyons who announces how much 
    the gold marc is worth in ecus. This is known as 'quoting certain.`,
    `However, the price of ecus in gold marcs is not known and depends on the state of the market. 
    Other bankers in Lyons can bid for bills in ecus and pay the bearer in marcs. This is known as 
    'quoting moveable'. The city that quotes moveable is lower in the hierarchy than the city that 
    quotes certain. This means that 1 gold marc drawn on Lyons could be 64 ecus but the other way 
    round it could be more, say 65.5 ecus. A banker in Lyons then may buy a bill for 65.5 ecus for 
    1 gold marc. In our example, this price has already been decided. There will be a more complex 
    board where multiple exchange bankers can quote different prices.`,
    `There are two new players on the board; a new importer from Florence, Federigo and a new 
    exporter in Lyons, Piero. In this sense they are the mirror image of 'Me' and Salviati. They 
    will make a transaction that amounts to 65.5 ecus/ 1 gold marc. In Davanzati's example Piero 
    exports goods worth 65.5 ecus to Federigo and presents his bill to Tomasso receiving 1 gold 
    marc in return. Quotes and exchange rates have been added for reference.

    `In Catholic Europe, Usury laws prohibited making interest from loans. This also included 
   selling money for more than its stated price. This transaction circumvates usury laws because 
   in Lyons, the ecus were bought for the price stated in the conto. It just so happens that a 
   gold marc in Lyons will fetch more ecus than a gold marc in Florence. The exchange bankers often
   used this to their advantage using such transaction networks.`,
